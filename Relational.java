/*
    Relational operators in Java are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).
    Here are the six relational operators:
    == (Equal to): Checks if two operands are equal.
    != (Not equal to): Checks if two operands are not equal.
    < (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
    > (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
    <= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
    >= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand
